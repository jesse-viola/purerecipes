## How to install Golang

1. https://golang.org/doc/install
    * Follow the steps and install the tar, you may be able to use something like yum to manage the installation instead.
    * After setting the GO variables in the .bashrc I recommend you installing the Visual Studio Code Go extension in the marketplace.

2. This is a concept called Go modules which can be read about here https://medium.com/mindorks/create-projects-independent-of-gopath-using-go-modules-802260cdfb51
   this is similar to package.json for node.
